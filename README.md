## About this script

This script was written in order to quickly install the latest version of GLPI (currently 10.0.05) on Ubuntu & Debian servers.

The script will install, Apache, MariaDB, PHP and dependencies, and download and install the latest version from the [Official GLPI repo](https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi) and configure the database for you.
Once the script is executed, the only thing you have to do will be to connect to GLPI.

The installation of GLPI is done without SSL. If you need to open access to GLPI from the outside and/or an SSL certificate, I recommend that you use a reverse proxy.

⚠️ It is strongly recommended to run this script on a fresh install.
